Introduction

Netflix, the worldâ€™s largest on-demand internet streaming media and online DVD movie rental service provider.it Founded August 29, 1997, in Los Gatos, California by Marc and Reed. It has 69 million members in over 60 countries enjoying more than 100 million hours of TV shows and movies per day Netflix is the worldâ€™s leading internet entertainment service with enjoying TV series, documentaries, and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. I was curious to analyze the content released in Netflix platform which led me to create these simple, interactive, and exciting visualizations and find similar groups of people.

Problem Statement

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.
In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.
Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.

In this project, you are required to do

1.Exploratory Data Analysis

2.Understanding what type content is available in different countries

3.Is Netflix has increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.

4.Clustering similar content by matching text-based features


Kmeans clustering
k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. k-means clustering minimizes within-cluster variances (squared Euclidean distances), but not regular Euclidean distances, which would be the more difficult Weber problem: the mean optimizes squared errors, whereas only the geometric median minimizes Euclidean distances. For instance, better Euclidean solutions can be found using k-medians and k-medoids.



ðŸ“– Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering
The agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm is a popular example of HCA. To group the datasets into clusters, it follows the bottom-up approach. It means, this algorithm considers each dataset as a single cluster at the beginning, and then start combining the closest pair of clusters together. It does this until all the clusters are merged into a single cluster that contains all the datasets.

This hierarchy of clusters is represented in the form of the dendrogram.
